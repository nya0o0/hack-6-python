    "### What are functions?\n",
    "A function is used to perform a task based on a particular input. Functions are the bread and butter of any programming language. We have used many functions already that are builtin to the objects we have interacted with. For example, we saw that `string` objects have functions to capitalize letters, or add spacing, or query their length. Similarly, `list` objects have functions to search for elements in them, or to sort. The next step in our journey to begin writing our own functions. This is only an introduction, as we will continue over time to learn many new ways to write more and more advanced functions.  "

    "### The basic structure of a function\n",
    "In Python functions are defined using the keyword `def`. Optionally we can have the function return a result by ending it with the `return` operator. This is not required, but is usually desirable if we want to want to assign the result of the function to a variable. If no return statement is added the function will return an object called `None`. This is a special variable in Python, like `True` and `False`. "

In general, the `EAFP` (ask forgiveness after getting caught) method is preferable, but both are typically used frequently in any program. "
